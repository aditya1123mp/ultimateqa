**# UltimateQA Automation Project**

This project is designed to automate various tasks on the UltimateQA platform, focusing on form interactions, login processes, and handling applications that evolve over time. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to automate different aspects of web applications, particularly those that are dynamic and regularly updated.

**## Features**

- **Form Automation**: Automates the process of filling out forms, including handling various input types, validations, and submissions.
- **Login Automation**: Automates the login process, ensuring secure and reliable authentication.
- **Evolving Application Automation**: Demonstrates techniques for automating applications that change over time, including dynamic content and UI changes.
- **Element Interactions**: Covers interactions with various simple elements like buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns.

**## Technologies Used**

- **Katalon Studio**: For building and executing the automation scripts.
- **Groovy**: Used within Katalon Studio for scripting and custom logic.

**## Project Structure**

- `Test Cases/`: Contains the test cases for each automated scenario, such as form filling, login, and interacting with elements.
- `Object Repository/`: Stores the web elements identified on the UltimateQA site for use in automation scripts.
- `Global Variables/`: Stores variables that are used across multiple test cases, such as login credentials and dynamic URLs.
- `Profiles/`: Contains different environment profiles for testing, such as development, staging, and production.

**## Getting Started**

**### Prerequisites**

- **Katalon Studio**: Ensure you have Katalon Studio installed on your machine.
- **Access to UltimateQA**: You should have access to the UltimateQA site to run and validate the automation scripts.

**### Setup**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Katalon Studio.
3. Update the global variables or profiles with your credentials and specific URLs as required.
4. Run the test cases located in the `Test Cases/` folder to start the automation.

**### Running the Tests**
1. Open a specific test case that you want to run.
2. Click on the "Run" button in Katalon Studio.
3. The test case will execute the scripted actions, such as filling out forms, logging in, and interacting with web elements.

**## Customization**
- **Form Data**: Modify the test data used in form submissions to suit your testing needs.
- **Dynamic Element Handling**: Adjust the scripts to better handle dynamically changing elements in the application.
